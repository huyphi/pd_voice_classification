# Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease using Voice:
## By Huy Phi:

Hi! My name is Huy and welcome to my project. I have keen interest in neurodegenerative diseases and decided to try to do some machine learning classification of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using voice extracted features. This project encapsulates the programming concepts I learned in CSE 163 and allowed me to apply to something I learned in the classroom, and in my research.
